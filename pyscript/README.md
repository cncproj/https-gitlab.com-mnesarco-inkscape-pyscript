= Inkscape Python Scripting Extension

This is a very work in progress project to add general purpose python scripting capabilities to Inkscape.

== Documentation

*TODO*

Look at pyscript_samples/py-car-y2.svg file to see how it works.

== Install

Copy all files and folders inside you inkscape extensions dir, in my environment there two possible places:

 - $HOME/.config/inkscape/extensions/
 - /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/

== Try

The extension will appear in extensions menu inside Inkscape:

* Extensions
    * Python Scripting
        * Code Editor (Will start the editor to write/edit code)
        * Run and Update (Will run your code without opening the editor)
