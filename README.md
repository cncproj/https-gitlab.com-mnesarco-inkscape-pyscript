# Inkscape Python Scripting Extension

This is a very work in progress project to add general purpose python scripting capabilities to Inkscape.

## Documentation

*TODO: Write good docs*

Look at pyscript_samples/ to see how it works. 

## Install

*Requires Inkscape 0.92.x, Python 2.7+, Gtk 3.x*

Copy all files and folders inside you inkscape extensions dir, in my environment (Mint 18 + Inskacape 0.92.4 + Python 2.7.12) there are two possible places:

 - $HOME/.config/inkscape/extensions/
 - /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/


Has been tested only on Linux Mint 18.x

## Try

The extension will appear in extensions menu inside Inkscape:

* Extensions
    * Python Scripting
        * Code Editor (Will start the editor to write/edit code)
        * Run and Update (Will run your code without opening the editor)
